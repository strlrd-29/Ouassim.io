```

# 5. State management

# 7. Type Checkers

JavaScript is a loosely typed language which means that it does not require a variable to be defined. As your application grows, you may find yourself dealing with type-related bugs. That's why it's good to use a type checker.

-   Here are some type checkers that you can use with React:

    -   PropTypes.

    -   Typescript. (Highly recommend learning it)

    -   Flow.

```
