# Bloody Peasant!

The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land. Ah, now we see the violence inherent in the system!

Now, look here, my good man. Bloody Peasant! A newt? **Found them?** _In Mercia?!_ The coconut's tropical!

## I have to push the pram a lot.

Well, she turned me into a newt. A newt? Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! Shut up!

1. It's only a model.
2. Well, how'd you become king, then?
3. Burn her anyway!

### Bloody Peasant!

And the hat. She's a witch! And the hat. She's a witch! Who's that then? But you are dressed as one… Well, how'd you become king, then?

-   Well, I didn't vote for you.
-   What a strange person.
-   Why?

How do you know she is a witch? Shut up! Shut up! Will you shut up?! How do you know she is a witch? Look, my liege! We want a shrubbery!!

Burn her! Be quiet! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Listen. Strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

We want a shrubbery!! Shut up! Will you shut up?! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. And the hat. She's a witch! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

Burn her! What a strange person. Burn her! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! He hasn't got shit all over him.

I am your king. Well, what do you want? …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? A newt? But you are dressed as one… The nose?

We want a shrubbery!! Oh! Come and see the violence inherent in the system! Help, help, I'm being repressed! Burn her! Well, how'd you become king, then?

I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries! Now leave before I am forced to taunt you a second time! Be quiet!

Well, I didn't vote for you. Bring her forward! Bring her forward! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!

I have to push the pram a lot. And the hat. She's a witch! Why do you think that she is a witch? You don't vote for kings. The nose?

I'm not a witch. Look, my liege! The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.

What do you mean? You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits!
