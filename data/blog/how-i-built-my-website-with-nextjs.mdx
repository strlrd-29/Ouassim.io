# No! The cat shelter's on to me.

Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel though they may be… You mean while I'm sleeping in it?

File not found. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?! Oh, but you can. **But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil.** _ And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil._ And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

## I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died.

It's toe-tappingly tragic! Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. I haven't felt much of anything since my guinea pig died. I'm Santa Claus! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?

1. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?
2. Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.
3. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.

### Leela's gonna kill me.

Yes, if you make it look like an electrical fire. When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all. Bender, quit destroying the universe! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it!

-   Whoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume?
-   Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.
-   For the last time, I don't like lilacs! Your 'first' wife was the one who liked lilacs!

Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Large bet on myself in round one. What are you hacking off? Is it my torso?! 'It is!' My precious torso! Guess again. And when we woke up, we had these bodies.

Well, then good news! It's a suppository. Tell her she looks thin. Negative, bossy meat creature! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun? Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying! You don't know how to do any of those. Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.

Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! And when we woke up, we had these bodies.

Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. Shut up and get to the point! Can we have Bender Burgers again?

I'm Santa Claus! You are the last hope of the universe. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions? I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!

It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? It doesn't look so shiny to me.

Shut up and take my money! Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.

A true inspiration for the children. No, just a regular mistake. Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain.

Bite my shiny metal ass. Now, now. Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything. Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

Bite my shiny metal ass. You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Ask her how her day was. Meh.
